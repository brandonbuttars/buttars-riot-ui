# Buttars Riot UI
Simply put, Buttars Riot UI is a component based library that supports many more browsers than other component 
libraries without the harry polyfills.

1. Build reuseable custom HTML elements.
2. Integrate into any project.
3. JavaScript however you want.
4. Support IE8+.
5. Support more devices.

## Blah Blah Blah

<!--Component based design is the next big thing or current big thing depending on when you read this.  RiotJS seems to be the most lightweight way to accomplish building custom components.  

I worked with Polymer which is super dope, but there is definitely more involved with Polymer and it's currently not very nice to all browsers.  You have to use polyfills and some browsers you have to give up support completely.

Riot claims support clear back to IE8 which attracted me.  I had a project requiring a lot of legacy browser support but still wanted to try and build it with components if possible.-->
